# Explanation of a C Program implementing a Singly Linked List

This code implements a singly linked list in C language.

A linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes, each containing a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. In this program, the nodes are defined using a struct, which contains two fields - `data` and `next`.

## `createNode` Function

The `createNode` function dynamically allocates memory for a new node and initializes its data and next pointer fields based on the input parameters. This function is used to create new nodes as needed.

## `add_node` Function

The `add_node` function adds a new node to the end of the linked list by first traversing the list to find the last node, and then adding the new node as its next node. If the linked list is empty, the new node is added as the head node.

## `traverse` Function

The `traverse` function iterates through the linked list, starting at the head node, and prints the value of each node in the list.

## `main` Function

The `main` function creates an array of integers, and uses a for loop to add each element to the linked list using the `add_node` function. Finally, the `traverse` function is called to print the contents of the linked list.
